this is a project that make use of opencv library to recognize "boxes" on the screen and then move the mouse to the center of the box by finding the most comfortable position for the user so that they feel good when turning off or getting away from their laptop

this is to solve the problem which I wasted a lot of time to adjust the mouse on the laptop before turning off and sleep due to my OCD
